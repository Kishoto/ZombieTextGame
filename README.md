# ZombieTextGame
A text adventure game done in python

Currently, this repository is the base export of the zombie text adventure game I created. If the RunGame.py file is opened in IDLE (Python version 3) and ran if it's in the same folders as the other python files, it will begin a text adventure game. You can control it by typing left, right, etc. and the encounters are also controlled via text, based on a map that's intended to be randomly generated. 

There's a help command that pops up if an incorrect command is entered.
